## What is it?

Skyline Plot is a privacy-focused web app for visualizing flight track data. Load KML files and watch multiple aircraft move in synchronized 3D. All processing happens in your browser—no data leaves your machine unless you choose to share.

## Key Features

- **Multi-track synchronization** — Load up to 10+ flights and watch them replay together on an interactive timeline
- **Proximity analysis** — Real-time distance matrix between all aircraft pairs with gate crossing detection
- **GPS quality filtering** — Automatic detection and filtering of GPS anomalies and acquisition errors
- **Route builder** — Define waypoints and gates to analyze approach patterns and verify flight paths
- **Client-side processing** — Zero backend data collection by default; your flight data stays private
