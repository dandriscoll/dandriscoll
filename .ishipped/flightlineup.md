## What is it?
FlightLineup.com helps pilots sketch and brief formation lineups right in the browser. Build a roster, place each ship on a grid, and keep everything local unless you choose to share a link. Export a clean, print-ready view when it is time to fly.

## Key Features
- **Grid lineup builder** — Add/remove rows and columns, drag ships between slots, and keep the formation layout tidy.
- **Roster import/export** — Pull crew lists from CSV or save them back out for reuse.
- **Print and PNG export** — Capture the lineup as a download-ready image or send it straight to the printer.
- **Shareable links** — Post the setup to generate a link that preloads your layout for teammates.
- **Custom labels and colors** — Tag rows and columns and color-code rows to match the formation plan.
