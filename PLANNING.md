# Plan Structure

## Why

Every plan begins with a clear purpose: the problem being solved or the outcome being achieved.

## Milestones

Break work into milestones that represent major steps toward the purpose. Each milestone moves meaningfully closer to the goal.

## Detail Gradient

**Near-term**: Concrete and directive. Clear enough to execute without further clarification.

**Mid-term**: Less detailed. Defines direction and establishes scope.

**Far-term**: High-level only. Establishes what is in vs. what is out at each phase.
